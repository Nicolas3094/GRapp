            "bod1":"This series consists of 3 sculptures through which I explore the possibility of physically and ideologically materializing the fragmentation of the contemporary human being. To achieve this I have selected certain objects and materials strongly associated with daily life in today's society; a metal chair and a skeleton are the basis of the three sculptures as they are for such impartial acts as food or recreation. Some other materials have more specific connotations; for example, the honeycomb is related to the body's transcendence through mummification, the Coca-Cola bottle an unequivocal symbol of popular culture in this era.",
            "bod2":"Each of the different elements has precise socio-cultural connotations and it is the spectator's task to intuit them from his or her life experience. They are pieces created to be read individually. The title refers to the fragmentation itself of the meaning of a sentence, from stuttering as a physical way to achieve it, as my practice allows me with these sculptures.",
            "bod3":"The literal meaning of the title of this series basically defines the production process of the pieces that compose it, as well as the result of its final form.",
            "bod4":"What I try to achieve is an aesthetic cohesion between materials without any previous relationship. I like to imagine the sculptures in this series as particular situations which are possible as a result of my obsession with collecting different objects in the places I have been, and then use them in the composition of works of art that contemplate morphological cohesion as a foundation.",

It is from this point that this connection postulates the principle to obtain a coherent interpretation of the sculptures in the series, which relate to the human being at different levels. On a metaphysical level, the deer represents our connection with the natural and spiritual world, specifically Mexico's native tribes such as the Huicholes or Yaquis. In their worldview, this being represents man's brother ''The Blue Deer''.",
