    "info1": "Born in 1980 in Lagos de Moreno, Mexico, Gabriel Rico now lives and works in Guadalajara, Mexico.\nHis work is characterized by the interrelation of seemingly disparate objects. Self-proclaimed “ontologist with a heuristic methodology,” Gabriel Rico pairs found, collected, and manufactured materials and technologies to create sculptures that invite viewers to reflect on the relationship between humans and our natural environment. Rico frequently uses neon, taxidermy, ceramics, branches and more personal pieces of his past to create an equation or formulation. His works achieve a precise geometry despite the organic, roughly hewn character of their materials. His installations ironically and poetically combine natural and unnatural forms, insisting on a necessary contemplation on their asymmetry as well as our own cultural and political flaws.\n\nGabriel Rico studied architecture earning his BA from ITESO in 2004. He has been selected for awards such as Prince Claus Fund, 2011; binational fellowships as FONCA/ Colombian Ministry of Culture in 2013; and international fellowships such as Ténot Fondation Burbary in 2014 and ASU Art Museum & CALA Alliance award in 2017.\nHas taken international residencies such as in Seoul Art Space GEUMCHEON, 2012; DMZ International Peace Residency, Dongguk University, in Cheorwon-gun, South Korea, 2012; Sint-Niklaas, Belgium during WARP contemporary art platform, 2013 and Gyeonggi Creation Center, 2015.\nHe has exhibited in multiple museums and galleries such as BeiQiu Museum of Contemporary Art in Nanjing and Black Cube, 2022; Institute of Contemporary Art in San Diego, 2021; OMR in Mexico City, 2021; Perrotin in Paris, 2020; Perrotin in Seoul, 2019; The Aspen Art Museum in Colorado, 2019; The Power Station in Dallas, 2017; Gyeonggi Creation Center in Ansan-do, 2016. His work is included in the 58th International Venice Biennale."
